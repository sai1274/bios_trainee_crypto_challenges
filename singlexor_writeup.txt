In this question we were given with hex encoded string so we need to decode it. I t can be done with the help of following 
command: "string".decode('hex')
given that it was a single-byte cipher it means we XOR'd entire msg with only only char (a-z) so now we use a for loop to xor 
with each character and then count no.of letters are in readable format and then compare it with another high_score variable 
which keeps track of highest no.of readable characters. we'll store the string with high no.of reable characters. At the end we
will print it.
XOR can done with the help of the command:  chr(ord(a,16) ^ ord (b,16))
